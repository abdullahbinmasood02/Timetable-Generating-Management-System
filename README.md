# Timetable-Generating-Management-System
The project has been implemented using java fx in eclipse IDE
The signup page has options for admin/faculty but only admin has been implemented
The project uses mysql database and assumes necessary tables have already been created
Edit the database url to make it work
Moreover the user file contains most of the business logic and the databasemanager file contains database access
